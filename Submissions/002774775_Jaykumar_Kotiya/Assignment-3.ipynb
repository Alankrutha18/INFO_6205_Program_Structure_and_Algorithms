    "### ChatGPT Assistance and Challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assistance: ChatGPT was helpful in structuring the problem, designing the input and output format, and providing a sample problem. It also assisted in drafting a solution pseudocode. It provided definitions and examples that helped in understanding the problem context.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenges: \n",
    "\n",
    "Ensuring that the new problem maintained the spirit of the example problem was a challenge. I needed to ensure that the problem remained related to network flows and graph theory while introducing a new dimension to it. This involved designing a problem that required a deeper understanding of flow networks and minimum cuts."
