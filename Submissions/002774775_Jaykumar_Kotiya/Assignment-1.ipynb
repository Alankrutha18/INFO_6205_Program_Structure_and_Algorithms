    "To check which function has a higher growth rate, I'll use Big O notation to compare them. Big O notation helps me understand how functions grow relative to each other for large values of n.\n",

    "1. f(n) = 2n^2 + 3n:\n",
    "-> To express this in Big O notation, I need to find an upper bound function that is a simple polynomial.\n",
    "-> I notice that f(n) is bounded above by 2n^2 for all n > 1, as the linear term (3n) is overshadowed by the quadratic term (2n^2).\n",
    "-> Therefore, I can say that f(n) = O(n^2).\n",
    "\n",

    "As n becomes large, the growth rate of n^3 is higher than that of n^2. So, I conclude that g(n) has a higher growth rate than f(n)."
