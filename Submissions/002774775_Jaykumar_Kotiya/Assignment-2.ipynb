    "Find the Shortest Path in a Weighted Directed Graph\n",
    "Problem Statement:\n",
    "You are given a weighted directed graph and two distinct vertices, a source vertex S, and a destination vertex D. Your task is to find the shortest path from S to D in the given graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input Format:\n",
    "\n",
    "An integer N representing the number of vertices in the graph (1 <= N <= 10^5).\n",
    "An integer M representing the number of directed edges in the graph (1 <= M <= 10^5).\n",
    "N lines containing two integers each, U and V (1 <= U, V <= N), representing a directed edge from vertex U to vertex V.\n",
    "M lines containing three integers each, U, V, and W (1 <= U, V <= N, 1 <= W <= 1000), representing the weight of the directed edge from vertex U to vertex V.\n",
    "The source vertex S and destination vertex D are provided separately as two integers, where 1 <= S, D <= N and S â‰  D.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output Format:\n",
    "\n",
    "An integer representing the length of the shortest path from S to D. If there is no path from S to D, output -1.\n",

    "The graph is a directed graph with at most 10^5 vertices and 10^5 edges.\n",

    "\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the source vertex S to all other vertices in the graph. Then, we can return the distance from S to the destination vertex D.\n",

    "\n",
    "The correctness of Dijkstra's algorithm is well-established and proven. It guarantees finding the shortest path from the source vertex to all other vertices in the graph."
