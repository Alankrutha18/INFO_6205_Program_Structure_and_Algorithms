Assignment-3 "Summary of Assignment 2"

Question - 1

 I learned more about problem design in the realm of algorithms, specifically how to create a new problem 
 based on an example. It required understanding the core concepts and adapting them to a new scenario, all 
 while maintaining the algorithmic nature of the problem.

Question - 2

this task allowed me to design a new algorithmic problem based on the provided example. ChatGPT was 
instrumental in structuring the problem statement, input/output format, and sample inputs/outputs. It also 
helped in drafting a solution pseudocode. Challenges included ensuring that the problem maintained the spirit 
of the example while introducing new elements, such as lexicographically smallest path. This task improved my 
problem design skills and deepened my understanding of algorithmic problem-solving.
