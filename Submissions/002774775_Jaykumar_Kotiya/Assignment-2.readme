Assignment-2 "Summary of Assignment 2"

Question - 1

Challenge Faced:

I had to ensure that the new problem also involves finding a shortest path in a graph but with a different 
context (directed graphs instead of undirected, and specific source and destination vertices).

Defining input and output formats: Carefully defining the input and output formats to ensure that the problem
is clear and can be easily understood.

Learning:

Creating a new algorithmic problem based on the example problem was a valuable exercise in problem design. 
It required me to think about how to modify the problem while retaining its core concept. It also reinforced 
my understanding of algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm and the importance of defining clear inputs, outputs, 
and constraints.

I learned that problem design involves creativity and attention to detail. ChatGPT assisted by 
providing guidance.


Question - 2

Creating a new algorithmic problem based on the provided example problem was a creative process. I had to 
think about how to modify the problem while maintaining the spirit of analyzing recurrence relations.
Ensuring that the problem was well-defined and had clear input, output, and constraints was crucial to make 
it solvable. ChatGPT assisted by helping me structure the problem statement, providing sample inputs and outputs, and 
suggesting possible constraints.
The challenge was to come up with diverse recurrence relations that could be classified into different cases. 
It required a good understanding of the Master Theorem and its applications.
The experience taught me about problem design in the realm of algorithms and the importance of providing clear 
and unambiguous problem statements.


Question - 3

-> The challenge was maintaining the spirit of encoding folk songs while abstracting it into an algorithmic 
   problem.
-> This question emphasized the importance of finding efficient algorithms for real-world problems and thinking 
   about the asymptotic analysis of these algorithms.

Question - 4

Explanation of ChatGPT Assistance:
ChatGPT assisted in creating the new problem for the problem statement, input and output format, sample 
inputs and outputs, and constraints. It also provided a starting point for the solution and explained 
how to prove its correctness.

Challenges Faced:
Ensuring the problem maintains the spirit of the example while being different enough to provide a new challenge.
Designing an algorithm that is both efficient and correct for counting nodes with two children and leaves.
Formulating a clear and concise proof of correctness based on mathematical induction.

Learning About New Problem:
This task allowed me to learn about designing algorithmic problems based on existing examples, maintaining 
the core concept while introducing variations. It also reinforced the importance of providing clear problem 
statements, input/output specifications, and constraints. Additionally, proving the correctness of the 
algorithm through mathematical induction was a valuable learning experience in itself. ChatGPT's assistance 
was instrumental in structuring and formulating the problem, making the process smoother and more organized.

Question - 5

Explanation of ChatGPT's Assistance and Challenges Faced:

ChatGPT was instrumental in helping me design a new problem based on the provided example. The biggest 
challenge was ensuring that the new problem maintained the spirit of the example while introducing a fresh twist. In this 
case, I decided to adapt the concept of subsequences into a problem involving integer sequences, making it 
a relevant and interesting problem in the realm of algorithms.

I learned how to abstract a real-world problem, like detecting subsequences in time-series data, into a 
more general algorithmic problem. This skill is essential for transforming practical challenges into 
algorithmic ones.
