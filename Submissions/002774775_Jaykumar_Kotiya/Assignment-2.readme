Assignment-2 "Summary of Assignment 2"

Question - 1

Challenge Faced:

I had to ensure that the new problem also involves finding a shortest path in a graph but with a different 
context (directed graphs instead of undirected, and specific source and destination vertices).

Defining input and output formats: Carefully defining the input and output formats to ensure that the problem
is clear and can be easily understood.

Learning:

Creating a new algorithmic problem based on the example problem was a valuable exercise in problem design. 
It required me to think about how to modify the problem while retaining its core concept. It also reinforced 
my understanding of algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm and the importance of defining clear inputs, outputs, 
and constraints.

I learned that problem design involves creativity and attention to detail. ChatGPT assisted by
