Q-2 Summary

In this example, I have used wiki website, khanAcademic website and used
chatGpt to undersand the concept of Asymptotic notations. Resourses links
are mentioned below. 

I've demonstrated that the function f(n) = 2n^2 + 3n is indeed O(g(n)), 
where g(n) = n^2. This means that f(n) grows at most as fast as g(n) for 
some positive constant factor and for sufficiently large values of n.

Asymptotic notations, such as Big O, allow us to analyze the growth rates 
of functions and compare their efficiencies as the input size (n) grows. 
In this case, I've determined that the growth rate of f(n) is no faster 
than that of g(n) when n becomes sufficiently large.
