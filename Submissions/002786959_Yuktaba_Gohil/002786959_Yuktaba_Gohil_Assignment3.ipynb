    "\n",
    "To solve the problem of distributing evacuees to evacuation centers while ensuring that no center receives more than [n/k] people, we can use a polynomial-time algorithm. The algorithm can be structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm: Distributing Evacuees to Centers\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Initialize a flow network with nodes representing evacuees, evacuation centers, and a source and sink.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Create an edge from the source to each evacuee with a capacity of 1, representing that each evacuee can be assigned to one center.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Create an edge from each evacuee to each evacuation center with a capacity of 1, representing the possibility of assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Create an edge from each evacuation center to the sink with a capacity of [n/k], representing the limit on the number of people each center can accommodate.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Apply the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm or any polynomial-time max-flow algorithm to find the maximum flow in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ If the maximum flow is equal to n (the number of evacuees), it means that it's possible to assign each person to an evacuation center while ensuring that no center receives more than [n/k] people. Return \"Possible.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "+ If the maximum flow is less than n, it's not possible to distribute all evacuees while respecting the constraints. Return \"Not Possible.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm creates a flow network in which each evacuee is connected to each evacuation center. The maximum flow in this network represents the number of evacuees that can be successfully assigned to centers without overloading any of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the maximum flow equals n, it means it's possible to distribute all evacuees while ensuring that no center receives more than [n/k] people. If the maximum flow is less than n, it's not possible to meet the constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm runs in polynomial time, making it an efficient way to determine the feasibility of distributing evacuees to centers while maintaining balance and respecting the specified constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm can be applied to real-world scenarios where resource allocation during crises, such as natural disasters, is critical for saving lives and ensuring the efficient use of evacuation centers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relevance to the Sample Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The sample problem presented a network flow problem in the context of distributing injured individuals to hospitals during a crisis. The challenge was to allocate individuals to hospitals while avoiding overloading any single hospital. This problem required finding a balanced assignment of individuals to hospitals.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The problem created by me is relevant to the original problem as it also involves allocating individuals to facilities (evacuation centers) during a disaster, with the added constraint of time sensitivity. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Reflection Quality**\n",
    "\n",
    "+ I used ChatGPT to create a question and brainstorming potential algorithmic solutions.\n",
    "+ The algorithm I designed is based on flow network principles, where we represent individuals and centers as nodes and allocate capacities through edges.\n",
    "+ This approach helps in structuring and solving such problems efficiently."
